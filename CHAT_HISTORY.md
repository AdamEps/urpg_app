## 2025-01-27 - Blueprint Button Improvements & Dev Tool

### User Requests:
1. **Grey out medium/large blueprint buttons when no unlocked bays** - If there isn't an unlocked medium bay, make the medium blueprints button greyed out. Same for large.
2. **Add dev tool option to Constructables page** - Let's add a dev tool option to Constructables page, to see all Enhancement Abilities.

### Implementation:
1. **Blueprint Button Greying**:
   - Added `hasUnlockedBay(of size: BaySize)` helper function to check if any bay of a specific size is unlocked
   - Modified bay size selector buttons to:
     - Show grey text when no bays of that size are unlocked
     - Disable button interaction when no bays are unlocked
     - Only allow selection of unlocked bay sizes
   - Only the first small bay is unlocked by default, so medium and large buttons will be greyed out initially

2. **Enhancement Abilities Dev Tool**:
   - Added "DEV" button to BlueprintsView header (red background, similar to existing dev buttons)
   - Created `EnhancementAbilitiesView` with detailed information about all 3 enhancement abilities:
     - **Excavator**: +25% resource collection efficiency, 500 discovery cost
     - **Laser Harvester**: Passive harvesting every 30s, 750 discovery cost  
     - **Virtual Almanac**: Location intelligence with full details, 1000 discovery cost
   - Each ability card shows icon, name, effect type, effect value, discovery cost, and description
   - Added proper navigation with "Done" button to dismiss the sheet
   - Used consistent styling with the rest of the app (black background, proper colors)

### Technical Details:
- Modified `BlueprintsView` to include state for showing enhancement abilities sheet
- Added `EnhancementAbility` model struct for ability data
- Created `EnhancementAbilityCard` view component for displaying individual abilities
- Used sheet presentation for the dev tool to maintain navigation flow
- All enhancement abilities are defined as medium bay constructables as per previous implementation

### Status:
- ✅ **Blueprint Button Greying**: Complete - Medium and large buttons are greyed out when no bays of that size are unlocked
- ✅ **Enhancement Abilities Dev Tool**: Complete - Added comprehensive dev tool showing all enhancement abilities with detailed information
- ✅ **App Testing**: Launched app to verify changes work correctly
